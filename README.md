# ColorMatching
A WPF ColorMatching-Game build on .Net Core.

This is my first app build with WPF-Scheme and I quiet liked it.

## About the App
Simply use the sliders to match the color in the right bubble/circle with the one of the left. Then check its percentage with the given Color or generate a new one.

The resulting percentage is not exactly reflecting the human interpretation of color-equality. It is only the **mathmatical percentage of the two colors compared to each other**.
